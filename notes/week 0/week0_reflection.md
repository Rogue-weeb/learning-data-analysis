I want to become faster and more confident with Excel data cleaning functions like TRIM, IFERROR, and removing duplicates — before transitioning into SQL and Python.

### 💡 My Favorite Moment This Week
Building my first interactive Excel dashboard with slicers. Seeing the charts update instantly made me feel like a real data analyst.

### 🧭 How I Feel About Next Week
