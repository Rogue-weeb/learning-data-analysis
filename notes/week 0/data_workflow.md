# Data Analysis Workflow â€” Summary (Day 6)

## ðŸ§­ Typical Steps
1. **Data Collection** â€” getting data from sources (CSV, SQL, APIs, etc.)
2. **Data Cleaning** â€” removing errors, handling missing values
3. **Exploration & Analysis** â€” identifying patterns, relationships
4. **Visualization** â€” showing results clearly (charts, dashboards)
5. **Communication** â€” presenting insights to decision-makers
6. **Action** â€” business decisions or process improvements

## ðŸ§  Reflection
- What part of the workflow do I find most interesting?  
- Where does **Excel** fit in this pipeline?  
- Which parts will require learning **SQL** or **Python** later?
