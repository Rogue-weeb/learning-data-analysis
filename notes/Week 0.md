# 🗓️ Week 0 Summary – Foundations Setup

> **Goal:** Build the base for my data analysis journey — organize tools, learn GitHub, and start tracking progress like a professional analyst.

---

## 🧠 What I Learned So Far

### 1️⃣ Understanding the Data Analyst Journey
- Data analysis is about **asking questions and finding answers with data.**
- The key stages are:
  1. **Collect** data  
  2. **Clean** data  
  3. **Analyze** and **visualize**  
  4. **Communicate** insights  
- Tools used across this journey include **Excel**, **SQL**, **Python**, and **BI tools** like Power BI or Tableau.
- Documentation and version control (like GitHub) are also part of a data analyst’s workflow — not just coding.

---

### 2️⃣ Setting Up My Environment
- Created my GitHub account and first repository:  
  `learning-data-analysis`
- GitHub is where I’ll store:
  - My daily progress log (`progress.md`)
  - Notes (`/notes`)
  - Datasets (`/data`)
  - Practice files (`/excel`, `/sql`, `/python`)
- I also set up a **Notion tracker** to record:
  - Daily tasks  
  - What I learned  
  - Next steps  
  - Links to GitHub progress  

🧩 **Why this matters:**  
Having this structure keeps me organized and builds a visible portfolio of my learning process — something employers love to see.

---

### 3️⃣ Learning Git & GitHub
- **Git** = a system that tracks changes in files (version control).  
- **GitHub** = a platform that stores those versions in the cloud for collaboration and portfolio building.  
- **Repository (Repo):** A project folder tracked by Git.  
- **Commit:** A snapshot of the current state of my files (like a checkpoint).  
- **Push/Pull:** Upload (push) or download (pull) changes between my computer and GitHub.

🧠 **Why analysts use GitHub:**
- To keep analysis projects organized and versioned.  
- To collaborate with other analysts or teams.  
- To showcase projects in a professional, transparent way.

### 4️⃣ Creating My Folder Structure
I set up a professional folder layout in my repo:

learning-data-analysis/
│
├── data/ → datasets (CSV, Excel files)
├── notes/ → study notes and reflections
├── excel/ → Excel dashboards & practice
├── sql/ → SQL queries and scripts
├── python/ → Python notebooks and scripts
└── progress.md → daily log of what I did and learned


🧾 *This structure mirrors what professional data analysts use in real projects.*

---

### 5️⃣ My First Dataset
- Created and uploaded a file named: Sales_data-sample.csv
- This will be used for Excel practice and analysis next.

💡 **Lesson learned:**  
CSV (Comma-Separated Values) is the simplest, most universal data format. It works in Excel, Python, SQL, and Power BI.

---

### 6️⃣ Tracking Progress
I’m tracking progress in two places:
- **GitHub:** via `progress.md` (for public documentation)
- **Notion:** for my personal notes, links, and daily logs

Each day I record:
- What I did  
- What I learned  
- My next step  

This helps build **consistency** and **accountability**.

---

### 7️⃣ Soft Skills I’m Already Building
- Organization — through GitHub + Notion  
- Documentation — by writing clear commit messages and notes  
- Reflection — by summarizing what I learn  
- Storytelling — starting to communicate what I did and why it matters  

---

## 🏁 Reflection
> "I’m building habits, not just skills.  
> Every commit, note, and dataset is a small step toward becoming a professional data analyst."
